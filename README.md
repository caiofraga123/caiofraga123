## Hi there, I'm Caio Fraga Coelho CintraðŸ‘‹

I'm an Internet Computing Technician at IFES - Serra, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UFES - VitÃ³ria - Goiabeiras. Over the course of my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to explore different areas of technology and develop a strong foundation in programming and software development.

Iâ€™ve learned Python, JavaScript, Java, C, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and PHP throughout my studies, and Iâ€™ve developed several projects using these languages in both academic and personal contexts. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability in the constantly evolving field of technology.

As a developer, Iâ€™m deeply interested in learning more about new technologies that can contribute to society in meaningful ways. I enjoy understanding how technology can be applied to real-world problems and how innovation can make a positive difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Iâ€™m also passionate about continuously evolving my skills, exploring new tools, frameworks, and paradigms that challenge the way I think and create.

My goals in Web 3 are to expand my knowledge in an area that fascinates me and to understand how decentralized technologies can reshape the internet as we know it. I see Web 3 as an exciting frontier where creativity, security, and collaboration intersect. I expect it to be as intriguing and mind-blowing as few people could imagine, opening new doors for growth, innovation, and community-driven development.

Ultimately, I aim to be part of this transformation, contributing to projects that not only push technological boundaries but also create value for society as a whole.
